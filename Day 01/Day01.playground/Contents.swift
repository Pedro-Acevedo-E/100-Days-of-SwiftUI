/*
 What was learned:
    1- Variables are declared with "var" keyword
    2- Constants are declared with "let" keyword and its value cannot be changed after declaration
    3- For swift a good variable naming convention is used called "camel_case"
    4- Whenever nescesary always try to use constants first, this helps optimizes our code

/*
 What was learned:
    1- To store strings you need " (double quotes)
    2- You can write emojis in strings
    3- If you need to write "" inside a string you can use /
    4- If you need to write multiline strings you can use """ (Triple double quotes)
    5- There are many operations swift can do with strings, most of them are uppercase sensitive

    1- To declare an integer just assign a "whole" number to a variable or constant

 What was learned:
    1- To declare a decimal number just assign a number that includes a "." for example 9.56
    2- You cannot combine integers with doubles in the same operations, you must transform the number before you continue
